            <h3>Where are the wedding events happening?</h3>
            <p>All of our wedding events will be taking place at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ktdzF95cHNZtrPfY6">Cigarral de las Merecedes</a> in Toledo, Spain!</p>
            
            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">How do I get to the venue?</h3>
            <p>We recommend flying into Madrid, which is the closest airport to Toledo. From Madrid, there are a few ways you can get to our venue:</p>
            <p>1. Reserve a private transfer directly from the Madrid Airport to Cigarral de las Mercedes. Driving takes 1-1.5 hours depending on traffic. This can be organized by emailing info@cigarraldelasmercedes.com</p>
            <p>2. Take a taxi or ride share app from Madrid. Madrid uses Uber, Bolt, and Cabify. We didn't use this option but were warned that the pickup location for ride share apps is confusing at the airport.</p>
            <p>3. Take the train from Madrid to Toledo. The train takes about 30 minutes from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nAccKzRHCqsfumu67">Madrid Atocha station</a>. We recommend you reserve your tickets in advance on <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en">Renfe</a> since trains sell out. Once at Toledo station, take a taxi or Bolt to the venue or your accommodations. Taxis started to arrive shortly after our train got in.</p>
            <p>4. Rent a car. There is free parking at Cigarral de las Mercedes if you choose this option.</p>
        
            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">How do I get around Toledo?</h3>
            <p>Toledo doesn't have Uber, but it does have Bolt and taxis. To call a Bolt, you'll need to download their app. To call a taxi, you can use the app TaxiClick or call 925-25-50-50. Cigarral de las Mercedes can also assist in calling taxis when you are leaving the venue.</p>
            <p>If you rented a car, driving inside of the old town seemed a bit scary (narrow cobblestone streets). You may want to find a place to park on the outskirts then walk.</p>
        
            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">Are kids allowed at the wedding?</h3>
            <p>While we love your little ones, they will not be allowed at the ceremony or reception. If you need childcare, the venue can help organize it. Please email info@cigarraldelasmercedes.com for more information.</p>
            <p>Kids are welcome at the other events on the day before and after!</p>

            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">Can I bring a plus one?</h3>
            <p>Due to venue capacity, we are only able to accommodate guests formally invited on your invitation. Please check your RSVP form to see who is included in your invite.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p>Don't forget to bring adapters for your chargers/electronics! If you plan on bringing hair appliances, you should also bring a converter so that there are no issues with the voltage. All rooms at Cigarral de las Mercedes have steamers for your clothes, so no need to worry about them getting wrinkled in your suitcase!</p>
       
            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">What should I do in Toledo?</h3>
            <p>If you have time, we highly recommend you explore the center of Toledo! Toledo is is a UNESCO World Heritage site known as the "City of Three Cultures" for its history of coexistence between Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities. The architecture of the medieval buildings reflect this history, and it's definitely worth checking out. Some attractions include:</p>
            <p>1. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/84sUmPDcE7siNcv6A">Alcántara Bridge</a></p>
            <p>2. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sneF6EQJkcMnwG5N8">San Martin Bridge</a></p>
            <p>3. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tpVQ7UM1ofNn36pHA">Alcázar de Toledo</a></p>
            <p>4. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rBmFbRMWeBVwH3nb8">Catedral Primada de Toledo</a> (worth going inside)</p>

            <p>6. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XjaKYTpjuNxqyJ1TA">Sinagoga de Santa María La Blanca</a></p>
            <p>7. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1eBrWEN2BGUHMgiL7">Mirador del Valle</a> (can take a Taxi/Bolt or the <a href="https://trainvision.es/">TrainVision</a>)</p>

            <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-bottom:20px;">There are some walking tours, a <a href="https://city-sightseeing.com/en-us/28/toledo">hop-on-hop-off bus</a>, and a <a href="https://trainvision.es/">TrainVision tour</a> if you would like a guided option.</p>

            <p>We also really enjoyed walking along the path next to the river! Here are some trails you can consider:</p>
            <p>1. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/spain/toledo/toledo-por-el-tajo">Toledo por el tajo</a></p>
            <p>2. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/spain/toledo/camino-natural-del-tajo-gr-113">Camino natural del tajo</a></p>
            <p>3. Some people recommend hiking up to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZPXd3KZvP7UU4vKv6">Piedra del Rey Moro</a> to see the view of Toledo</p>

            <p style="padding-top:20px;">Though we didn't have the time to try it, we were recommended to go to the spa at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3kmtZg8DKuJKkjFM7">Medina Mudéjar Toledo</a>. Looks like a nice place to relax after the long flight!</p>

            <h3 class="faq-header-padding">Why get married in Spain?</h3>
            <p>Our first big vacation together was in Spain (specifically Sevilla and Granada)! It was the start of our love of travel together (and Amanda's love of olives).
                We thought it would be the perfect place to return to for our wedding! We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!</p>
